            Mine and my partner's (Adrianna Turano) final project is a historical timeline following the French Revolution. One can <br>
            navigate the educational app through the usage of buttons bringing the user to various screens. Each screen held facts based <br>
            on the year in which the events occurred. Once the user completed their learning through reading the events in chronological order<br>
            the user can test their knowledge by taking a quiz based on the information presented. For the quiz, the user simply had to click<br>
            on the answer they believed to be correct based on the question asked. If they were correct they would be told, and the same for<br>
            if they were incorrect. At the end of the quiz, the user would be told their total score based on how many questions they answered<br>
            correctly.
