Hello, my name is Joseph Amaral and this is my website for CSC 106 at the University of Rhode Island. This course is also knowm as the <br>
    Joy of Programming. The purpose of this website is to have a hub to place all of my work throughout the course of this class in a sort <br>
    of portfolio style. If you click on the javascript tab you will find the javascript work we do in class, if you click on the apps tab you <br>
    will find apps that I make in this course. Lastly, the about me tab will contain some information about me as can be assumed.
